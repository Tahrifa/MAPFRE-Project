# MAPFRE-Project
MAPFRE Group is a global insurance group doing business in over 100 countries across five continents. In US it has presence in 14 states. It offers a wide range of insurance solutions for the home and vehicle. 

My role was to build a Digital Workplace for MAPFRE Insurance Company. I ensured the productiveness of companyâ€™s employees by applying the processes of data analysis, statistical analysis and machine learning models on OneDrive, SharePoint, Skype and Teams data using Python and various data visualization tools.
